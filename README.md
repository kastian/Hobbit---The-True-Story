## Story

This game is about what really happened to Bilbo Baggins on his famous
adventure. The story, in somewhat corrupt versions, has been told in a book -
The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien, and several computer games, among them Hobbit.
You play the part of Bilbo, and your goal is to journey to Smaug, the great
red dragon in the land beyond the river, and return with treasure. For an
assistant you have Thorin the dwarf and Gandalf the powerful wizard. They
will do everything within their power to guide you and to help you. Well,
almost everything, as long as they don't have to get into any trouble
themselves. Or get wet, for that matter. Or cold.

Sample sentences that the parser will recognize:

(_Note that everything must be typed in lower case._)

`take chest`

`show gandalf chest`

`show the chest to gandalf`

`drop the chest`

`inventory`

`i`  *(Short for inventory)*

`get the chest`

`ask gandalf about the spell`

`talk to thorin about chest`

`examine chest`

`x chest` *(Short for examine chest)*

`hint`

`clue`

`look`

`l` *(Short for look)*

`go east`

`e` *(Short for go east)*

`enter the chest`

`wait`

`save jake1`

`restore jake1`

`restart`

`quit`

## The redux, Director's Cut version

The new version restores a lost scene which had to be cut in order to get
a PG rating. This rare footage includes some nudity, but this was considered
to be rather mild by today's standards. The improved version also includes
two new commands, "save" and "restore", along with some added dialogue.
